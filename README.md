# Basic Calculator Application

This Node.js application is a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. It uses the `inquirer` package to interact with the user and perform calculations based on user input.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- **Interactive User Input**: Uses `inquirer` to prompt the user for input and operator choice.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/basic-calculator.git
   cd basic-calculator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Calculator:**

   Execute the script using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node calculator.js
   ```

2. **Provide Input:**

   The application will prompt you to enter two numbers and select an arithmetic operator. It will then display the result of the selected operation.

## Code Overview

- **Input Handling**: 
  - Prompts the user to enter two numbers.
  - Asks the user to select an arithmetic operator.

- **Arithmetic Operations**:
  - **Addition**: Adds the two numbers.
  - **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
  - **Multiplication**: Multiplies the two numbers.
  - **Division**: Divides the first number by the second. Be cautious of division by zero errors.

- **Error Handling**: 
  - Displays an error message if an invalid operator is selected.

## Code Details

- **Prompt Questions**:
  - `firstNumber`: The first number input by the user.
  - `secondNumber`: The second number input by the user.
  - `operator`: The operation to perform (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).

- **Conditional Statements**:
  - Determines which operation to perform based on the selected operator.

## Example

```bash
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 3
Select one of the operators to perform action: Addition
```

**Output:**
